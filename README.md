# The Seneschal

![The Seneschal Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/saimano/image/upload/v1696143767/seneschal/screenshot.png)

**The Seneschal** is a powerful tool that empowers DAO operators to grant shares, loot, and rewards to value-creating participants. This tool enables the creation of piecemeal task-to-task incentives within DAOs, all while maintaining a non-coercive and high-trust environment. It's designed to enhance the functionality and flexibility of decentralized autonomous organizations.

**Key Features:**

- Grant shares, loot, and rewards within your DAO.
- Create piecemeal task-to-task incentives for participants.
- Enhance trust and transparency in your organization.
- Built using modern technologies like Next.js, Hats Protocol, Arweave and more.

## Getting Started

This starter kit is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), GraphQL, OpenAI, Arweave, IPFS (using [nft.storage](https://nft.storage/) as the provider), [Hats Protocol](https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/), [Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/), [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/), [Viem](https://viem.sh/), [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/), and [Zod.js](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).

### Installation

To create your own instance of **The Seneschal**, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx create-seneschal-app --name <project-name>
```

## Prerequisites

- Requires the seneschal contracts to be deployed. Can be found here in this [repository](https://github.com/St4rgarden/kazoku).
- Requires a subgraph to your deployed seneschal contract which you can clone [here](https://github.com/manolingam/seneschal-subgraph/). Make sure to update the contract address at `subgraph.yaml`.

## Instructions

- Once you have the contracts & subgraph deployed, create a **Shaman Proposal** in [DAOHaus](https://admin.daohaus.club/#/) to grant DAO permissions to the seneschal contract.
- Mint the necessary hats to your DAO operators & grab the hat IDs from [here](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/).
- Using [nft.storage](https://nft.storage/) as the IPFS provider. You can either use the same or bring your own provider. Note that, if the provider is changed, you need to make appropriate code changes as well for interacting with IPFS.
- Update your environment variables by copying the sample environment file provided: `sample.env`.

Once you have your instance up and running, you can start customizing it to suit your needs.
